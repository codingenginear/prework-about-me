      <p>Love is the prerequisite of passion and passion is what relentlessly drives someone to continue to progress. Hence to be the best you can be, you must love what you do. Therefore, for a passionate individual it is absolutely imperative if not essential to find something they love to do. That is how I feel about "Coding" and "Web Development".
